# Skill Level Notifications
This plugin aims to notify the client when skill levels fall below a define threshold.

The first feature to be implemented is to notify the client when the player's magic level
falls below what is required for the currently selected autocasted spell. This provides the
player a chance to restore their magic level before attempting to autocast, which would
normally mean that the autocasted spell would become deselected and must be
reselected in the autocast menu.
