# Autocast Utilities
This plugin aims to notify the client when the player's magic level falls below the level 
required for the autocast spell.

This provides the player a chance to restore their magic level before attempting to 
autocast again, which would normally mean that the autocasted spell would become 
deselected and must be reselected in the autocast menu.
